I am a Mumbai based designer & my goal isn’t just to create something beautiful; it’s to understand the user’s mindset, predict what they will expect, and then make the design as user-friendly as possible.

Every brand has stories to tell—stories that will not only engage, inform, surprise, delight, and impact their audience, but that will also deliver on measurable business goals. And I am the conduit between brand and consumer, who help brands by conceptualizing and creating visual communication that meets their objectives.

My multi-disciplinary skill set that integrates UI design, common sense, knowledge of UX & Front-End development languages, Branding, Visual designs, and Good sense of humor makes me a valued contributor. 😊 😉

Have a glimpse of my work here 👉🏽 <a herf="https://linktr.ee/deep_designer">(Portfolio Links)</a> https://linktr.ee/deep_designer & I trust it will provide a little clarity on my skills and values in terms of design and aesthetics.

Looking out for full-time UI Designer opportunities. Also, if you have a project you’d like to collaborate on, then drop me an email at deepre602@gmail.com.

Looking forward to hearing from you. ☕️
